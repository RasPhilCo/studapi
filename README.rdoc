== StudAPI

HTML is pretty cool, but JSON makes API consumers happy, check out the files below:

* controllers/student_controller.rb

* models/students.rb

* views/students

Likewise, I've already run 'rails g scaffold Stud firstname lastname github' so you can see what the rails generator makes for a resource called Stud
